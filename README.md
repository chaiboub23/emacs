# emacs

this repository contains my simple emacs config, the majority of which is just a simple modification of Nicolas Rougier's [Elegant Emacs](https://github.com/rougier/elegant-emacs).

for some odd reason, the submodule containing my fork is broken, so make sure when you `git clone` the repo you run the following command as well:

```bash
git submodule update --remote --merge
```
